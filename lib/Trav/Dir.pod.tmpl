=item L<File::Find>

This is a Perl version of the Unix "find" utility. It is part of the
Perl core so is installed with Perl by default. Instead of passing
variables to callbacks as subroutine arguments, it passes them using
C<$_> and oddly-named pseudo-global variables like C<$File::Find::dir>
and C<$File::Find::name>. Callbacks have no avenue for passing
user-defined data, so one has to either use global variables or
anonymous subroutine closures. The module's documentation also notes
that it has given things the wrong name, within the documentation.

Trav::Dir started out as basically a script I had written so that I
didn't have to use File::Find again. After writing this module, I then
went back and replaced the uses of File::Find with this, so there are
some similarities.
